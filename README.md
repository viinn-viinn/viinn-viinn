### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Simone (going by viinn-viinn on GitHub) and thanks for stopping by! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal portfolio site. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Java. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fullstack applications, whether they're real-life solutions or inspired by a fictional world. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about entrepreneurship, accelerators, product, hiring, and accelerating startup growth.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me via email at [simonelapray@gmail.com] or connect with me on LinkedIn.
- ðŸ“š I'm trying to include more fiction in my reading time. If you happened to notice my profile pic - I'm working my way through the Dune series and thought that I should use a Fremen Octocat for my GitHub as I'm using this as a SAND...BOX... Ha ha ha. Hope that you enjoyed that cheesy joke and can't promise that you won't find a few more on this repo. Happy Hunting! ðŸª±
